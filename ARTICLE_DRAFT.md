### Australians pour $1 billion into gold and silver as precious metals surge

Australian investors have rushed into precious metals over the past year, with retail trading in gold and silver exchange-traded products topping $1 billion – and silver stealing the spotlight from its more famous cousin.

Trading data from the Australian Securities Exchange shows retail investors made more than 2.7 million trades in precious metal products between February 2025 and January 2026. But the real story is how dramatically that activity has accelerated.

Silver trades have increased tenfold. In February 2025, there were around 13,000 trades in silver-backed products across Australian brokers. By January 2026, that figure had jumped to nearly 147,000 trades – an increase of 1,000%.

The dollar values are even more striking. Australian retail investors bought just $6.2 million worth of silver ETFs in February 2025. By January 2026, that monthly figure had exploded to $107.7 million – a 17-fold increase.

So what's driving this rush into precious metals?

### Why silver is having its moment

While gold dominated headlines through much of 2024 and early 2025, silver has quietly become the hot topic among traders and on social media.

The numbers back up the hype. Silver prices have surged roughly 269% since February 2025, far outpacing gold's still-impressive 92% gain over the same period.

Silver's appeal comes from two directions. Like gold, it's seen as a safe haven – a place to park money when the world feels uncertain. Trade tensions, inflation concerns and geopolitical instability have all pushed investors toward assets that tend to hold their value.

But silver has something gold doesn't: industrial demand. Silver is a key component in solar panels, electric vehicles and electronics. As the world shifts toward renewable energy, demand for silver in manufacturing is growing alongside investment demand.

This "dual demand" makes silver attractive to investors who want both safety and exposure to the clean energy transition.

### Gold keeps climbing

Gold hasn't been left behind. The precious metal has climbed from around US$2,814 per ounce in early February 2025 to US$5,400 by late January 2026.

Australian investors bought nearly $580 million worth of gold-backed ETFs over the past year, making it the most popular precious metal by dollar value. Trading activity increased 47% year-on-year.

Gold's appeal as a safe haven remains strong. Uncertainty around US economic policy, ongoing conflicts and concerns about government debt levels have all contributed to sustained demand.

For many investors, gold represents insurance against the unexpected. When share markets wobble or currencies fluctuate, gold tends to hold its ground.

### The risks for everyday investors

The surge in precious metal prices has delivered enormous returns for early investors. But those jumping in now face different considerations.

Precious metals don't pay dividends or interest. Unlike shares or bonds, holding gold or silver doesn't generate income – investors rely entirely on price appreciation.

Prices can be volatile. While the long-term trend has been upward, precious metals can experience sharp corrections. Anyone investing money they might need in the short term could be forced to sell at a loss.

Timing matters. Investors buying after a major price surge may find themselves entering near a peak. The best gains often go to those who bought when nobody was paying attention.

### What to watch

Several factors could push precious metals higher or trigger a pullback.

On the upside, continued geopolitical uncertainty, central bank buying (particularly from China and other emerging economies) and growing industrial demand for silver could support prices.

On the downside, a resolution to trade tensions, falling inflation or rising interest rates could reduce the appeal of assets that don't pay income. A stronger US dollar would also typically weigh on precious metal prices.

For everyday investors considering precious metals, the key is understanding what role they play in a portfolio. Most financial advisers suggest precious metals work best as a small allocation – perhaps 5-10% – rather than a core holding.

The gold and silver rush shows no signs of slowing. But as with any investment that's already risen sharply, the question for new investors is whether the best gains are behind them.
